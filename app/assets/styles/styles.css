@import "normalize.css";

/* If you go back to the web browser, before I refresh, I want you to pay attention 
   to this tiny white margin you see on the left and right side of the browser. 
   So if I refresh, you can see it's gone. And you can thank normalize.css for that.

   Normalize is an alternative to CSSResets. 
   Its adjusts the styles of certain elements, in an effort to make all web browsers render things more consistently. 
   Normalize is excellent. I recommend using it on all of your projects */
