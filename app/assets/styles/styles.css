@import "normalize.css";

/* If you go back to the web browser, before I refresh, I want you to pay attention 
   to this tiny white margin you see on the left and right side of the browser. 
   So if I refresh, you can see it's gone. And you can thank normalize.css for that.

   Normalize is an alternative to CSSResets. 
   Its adjusts the styles of certain elements, in an effort to make all web browsers render things more consistently. 
   Normalize is excellent. I recommend using it on all of your projects */

/* Although @import is a native function of CSS 
   it is better to get postCSS to perform the import instead 
   in the gulp CSS Workflow pipe (using postcss-import)
    .. much faster performance of the final webpage */
